Requirements:
Java 8
Tomcat (if not running using maven plugin).

Run the app:
    1. Run maven install to build the war
    2. Either deploy to a tomcat compatible with Java 8, or run the maven jetty plugin
    3. To view the bill open a browser and go to http://localhost:8080/, or the root address for where the war has been deployed
