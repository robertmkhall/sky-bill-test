Requirements:
Java 8
Tomcat (if not running using maven plugin).

Run the app:
    1. Run maven install to build the war
    2. Either deploy to a tomcat compatible with Java 8, or run the maven jetty plugin
    3. Go to http://localhost:8080/ to view the bill. Or the root address for where the war has been deployed
